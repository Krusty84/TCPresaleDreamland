# TCPresaleDreamland [![Download on the Mac App Store](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/images/badge-download-on-the-mac-app-store.svg)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tcpresaledreamland/id6752539188) 

## What is this?

**TCPresaleDreamland** is your best friend when you need to impress stakeholders without showing the painful truth of real Teamcenter data.
It's a lightweight, one-click demo data generator tailored for **Presales Engineers**, **Solution Architects**, and other demo warriors who don't have time for real integrations.

> Create Items, BOM's, Requirement Specifications in seconds – no actual product knowledge required!

--

## Features

* Auto-generate **realistic-looking** Teamcenter objects
* Supports **Items**, **BOM's**, **Requirement Specifications**

  > *"This is just sample data for illustration purposes only."* ;)

--

## Who is it for?

* Presale folks who hear *"Can you show this use case?"* 3 minutes before the call
* Consultants tired of building fake data by hand

--

## Disclaimer

* This tool generates **mock data only** and is not intended for use in production systems.
* Any resemblance to real users, products, or workflows is purely coincidental (and lucky).
* **This only works with DeepSeek** as the base, and I don’t plan to support anything else. Feel free to take my code and adapt it however you like!

## Instructions below should be straightforward
