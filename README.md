## 🎯 Features

## 🧑‍💼 Who is it for?

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

* This tool generates **mock data only** and is not intended for use in production systems.
* Any resemblance to real users, products, or workflows is purely coincidental (and lucky).
* **This only works with DeepSeek** as the base, and I don’t plan to support anything else. Feel free to take my code and adapt it however you like!
