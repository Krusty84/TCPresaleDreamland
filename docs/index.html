    <h1>Privacy Policy for TCPresaleDreamland</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 14, 2025</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how TCPresaleDreamland ("the App") handles user data. The App is a client application designed to generate mock demo data for Siemens Teamcenter, a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system, to assist Presales Engineers, Solution Architects, and demo warriors in creating realistic-looking Teamcenter data using the DeepSeek API.</p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>The App collects and stores the following data locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Credentials:</strong> Your Teamcenter username and password, used solely to authenticate your access to the Teamcenter system for demo data generation.</li>
        <li><strong>Teamcenter Server Address:</strong> The URL or address of the Teamcenter server you connect to for generating mock data.</li>
        <li><strong>DeepSeek API Key:</strong> Your DeepSeek API key, used to access the DeepSeek API for generating mock demo data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No other personal or non-personal data is collected by the App. We do not collect analytics, usage data, or any other information about you or your device.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>The collected data (username, password, server address, and DeepSeek API key) is used exclusively to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Authenticate your access to Siemens Teamcenter via its REST API for the purpose of generating mock demo data.</li>
        <li>Access the DeepSeek API to generate realistic-looking Items, BOMs, and Requirement Specifications.</li>
        <li>Enable the App's functionality to create mock data within Teamcenter.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All data remains stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or any other third parties, except as required to communicate with the Siemens Teamcenter system for demo data generation and the DeepSeek API for data generation.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>The App does not share your data with any third parties, except for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Siemens Teamcenter:</strong> Processes your credentials and mock data (e.g., generated Items, BOMs, or Requirement Specifications) in accordance with your valid Teamcenter license and Siemens' Privacy Notice.</li>
        <li><strong>DeepSeek API:</strong> Your DeepSeek API key is used to interact with the DeepSeek service to generate mock data, in accordance with DeepSeek's privacy policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your credentials, server address, and DeepSeek API key are stored securely on your device using standard encryption practices. We do not store or process your data on our servers. Mock data generated by the App and processed by Teamcenter is managed under Siemens' security and privacy policies. Data processed by the DeepSeek API is subject to DeepSeek's security and privacy practices.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You can manage your data by modifying or deleting the credentials, server address, and DeepSeek API key stored in the App. To exercise additional data rights (e.g., access, deletion) related to data processed within Teamcenter, please contact your Teamcenter system administrator or Siemens directly. For data processed by the DeepSeek API, please refer to DeepSeek's privacy policy or contact their support.</p>

    <h2>Compliance with Laws</h2>
    <p>We comply with applicable privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for users in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) for users in California, to the extent that they apply. Since the App does not collect or share personal data beyond what is necessary for Teamcenter authentication and DeepSeek API-based mock data generation, no additional user consent is required.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the App's data practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:sedoykin@gmail.com">sedoykin@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
